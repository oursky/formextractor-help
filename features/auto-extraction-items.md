# Auto Extraction Items

## A quick guide

Auto Extraction Items are created to extract specific targets from documents that don't share a format, like receipts, tickets and invoices. 

To configure the list of targets you are seeking, navigate to the "Setting" tab in a Form's editor and tick the ones you need. Available items depends on the "Document Type", as shown in the following mapping:

**General**

* Date
* Time
* Name
* Address

**Receipt**

* Total Amount
* Date
* Time
* Address

**Bank Statement**

* Name
* Address
* Date

Say you have date ticked, FormX will attempt to return the best candidate it can find in uploaded image.
