# Templates

## A quick guide

Templates are [_Forms_](../background.md#what-is-a-form) __that we believe are sought after by many. Thus we have set them up beforehand allowing users to be able to use one straight away.

They work just like an ordinary Form, only without the "Editor" tab. Test them out like the usual ones at the "Test" tab.

Currently available forms are:

* Receipts \(general receipts\)
* Business Registration
* Food License
* Hong Kong ID \(New\)
* Hong Kong ID \(Old\)

Be sure to try them out!
