# Pre-defined Documents

## A quick guide

Templates are [_Forms_](../background.md#what-is-a-form) __ that many users frequently search for and use. We've set these templates up to make it more convenient for users to use FormX straight away.

Templates work just like an ordinary Form, only with the "Editor" tab. To test a template, navigate to the "Test" tab and upload a corresponding image.

## List of templates

FormX currently have these templates:

* Receipts (general receipts)
* Business Registration
* Food License
* Hong Kong ID (new format)
* Hong Kong ID (old format)

If you have forms that you think should go into the category of templates, please let us know!
