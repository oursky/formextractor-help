# Templates

## A quick guide

Templates are [_Forms_](../background.md#what-is-a-form) __that are sought after by many. Thus we have set them up beforehand allowing users to use one straight away.

They work just like an ordinary Form, only without the "Editor" tab. To test one out, navigate to the "Test" tab and upload an corresponding image.

## List of templates

Currently available forms are:

* Receipts \(general receipts\)
* Business Registration
* Food License
* Hong Kong ID \(New\)
* Hong Kong ID \(Old\)

If you have any forms that should go into the category of templates, don't hesitate to let us know!
