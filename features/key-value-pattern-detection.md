# Key Value Pattern Detection

## A quick guide

Sometimes you'd like to extract some target \(i.e. a "Value"\) based on its adjacent text, which in this feature one is called a "Key". We offer Key Value pattern matching for you to achieve this. 

## How to add a Key Value Pattern

To set a Key Value pattern, navigate to our "Key Value" tab under "Document" on the right bar and click the "Add Key Value" button. The following builder will pop up:

"Label" is for user reference purpose only, so enter something that describes this Key Value pair well. "Key" is the "anchor" to locate the "Value". Say you have a train ticket and you'd like to get the value under "Destination", input "Destination" as the key and change position to "Bottom". 

To boost the accuracy, a user can choose to provide a Regular Expression which we do offer a builder to aid you creating one.

From our preset patterns choose one that suits your value and optionally specify the length, then click "Apply".
