# Feature Pointing Guide

Below is a table on which feature\(s\) to go for with the target on left. You are still recommended to finish set up [one](set-up-a-form-with-master-image.md) and [two](set-up-a-form-without-master-image.md) before trying out any of them. 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Target</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Feature</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Forms with a shared format</td>
      <td style="text-align:left"><a href="set-up-a-form-with-master-image.md">Form with master image</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">Forms of the same type but different format</td>
      <td style="text-align:left"><a href="set-up-a-form-without-master-image.md">Form without master image</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
