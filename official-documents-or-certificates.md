# Official Forms or Certificates

## How does FormX fit in?

Forms and certificates from official bodies are likely to come with a well-defined structure. By dropping some _Anchors_ and pulling a few _Detection Regions_, FormX will learn about the format and consequently be able to extract.

In short, if there is a need to extract information from a collection of documents sharing the format, go for FormX's master form mode.

## Previous cases

### Documents issued by government bodies

Previously FormX played an integral part to the online application system of a financial support campaign in Hong Kong called [Instant Relief Fund](https://www.lksf.org/successful-completion-of-thecrunch-time-instant-relief-fund-projecttotal-distribution-amount-hk1-009-billion/). Through this campaign, small and medium-sized enterprises \(SMEs\) can apply for funds to aid them survive through recent economy slumps.

We worked with Google Cloud to provide data extraction models on documents issued by HK government including **Business Registration, Food Licence, Travel Agents Licence and Hawker Licence**. Applicants can take photos of their licence\(s\) and upload them, then FormX will take over and obtain target data off the images automatically.

### Vehicle licences

FormX helped a local parking giant to extract data off vehicle licences in parking lots. After a quick set up by FormX's team, inspector can simply walk up to a car and scan for information from vehicle licences sticked on the windshield.

### Appointment slips

Integrated into an appointment management app, FormX extracted information off appointment slips such as those medical ones issued by public hospitals in Hong Kong. Schedules can be added simply with a scan on any slips.

## Try them out!

A majority of these mentioned documents are available on FormX's portal as templates. No set up is needed, you can just upload an image to try a template out.
