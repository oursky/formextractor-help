# Home

This help page provides background information of FormX and aims to walk new users through scenarios where FormX can come in handy.

FormX extracts information from physical documents and returns structured data pairs in JSON format, making it integrate-able to any application. 

## For new users

If you are a newcomer and have no idea how FormX works, worry not! After reading the [Basics](background.md) and going through the get started tutorials, you will become familiar with working FormX.
