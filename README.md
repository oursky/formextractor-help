# FormX Documentation and Guide

This documentation provides background information about FormX and will walk users through business cases and scenarios where FormX can come in handy.

In a nutshell, FormX extracts information from physical documents and returns structured data pairs in JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) format, making it integrable with most systems and other software or applications.

If you're curious about how FormX works behind the scenes, you can read our blog posts on how FormX uses Artificial Intelligence \(AI\) to extract data and its use cases for business process automation.

## For new users

FormX is intuitive for both developers and end users. Read the basics and go through our "Get Started" tutorials to familiarize yourself with FormX.

If you are a newcomer and have no idea how FormX works, worry not! After reading the [Basics](background.md) and going through the get started tutorials, you will become familiar with working FormX.
