# Receipts or tickets

## How does FormX fit in?

In every Form on FormX, there is a list of Auto Extraction Items to choose from. By ticking one of them, say address, FormX will perform a search on anything from images uploaded that looks like an address according to our AI models and yield a result if one is located.

We also understand there is often the need to differentiate receipts and invoices by shop, as a result we have developed [Token Group](features/token-group.md). You can specify what tokens \(either a string or image\) you are seeking in a document, FormX will attempt to locate them and report afterwards if any is found. Please refer to the Token Group link for further details.

## Previous cases

### Receipts

Various shopping malls wished to establish a loyalty program with receipts where date, time and total price are needed. By plugging FormX  into their pipeline, customers can simply have their receipts scanned and receive loyalty points once data is extracted and processed.

### Bank statements

Address proof is often required in plenty of application process, and FormX processes the ability to recognize address from bank statements.
